# Adventure Game READMEA text-based adventure game set on Northwesternâ€™s campus.  Start at the Arch and make your way around six locations to make it to Lake Michigan.  I wrote the code to practice using Python dictionaries, inputs, and if/then/else all together.  See the image below for the map.
